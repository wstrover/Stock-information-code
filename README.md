# Stock information code
 
This code was made by me when I as a personal project when first learning python before university, it was chosen as I have family who wrks in stock brokerage and had learned and was interested in the topic.

The initial functions made ie Gainers, Losers, and TopETFs scrape the yahoo finance website to find what is published as the Stocks at the top of those catagories. It finds the number of companies in the list that is wanted, finds the information, then prints out some information along with a graph of the stock prices.

There is also a general function in which a companies shorthand(ie AAPL for Apple) or a list of company shorthands are used as an arguement then gets the comapny information aswell as creating a graph with an option to choose the timeframe of how far back the stock prices should be gotten from.#

finally there is a function that just finds information about a given company from the shorthand. As shown in the code the returned information can be assigned to a variable which then can be used in the future and have parts of the infromation printed out.

This code has been changed from it's initial creation due to some of the code and imports becoming depreciated and out of date over the years.
